This is a normal registration page using node.js which keeps a track on it's usage (requests, messeges, timestamp, etc) by using npm called 'winston'. Using this package we can store particular messeges on different collections. Here, successful requests are stored in 'api_logs' collection and bad requests are stored in 'api_errors' collection.
