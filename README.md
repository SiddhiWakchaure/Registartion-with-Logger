This is a normal registration page using node.js which keeps a track on it's usage (requests, messeges, timestamp, etc) by using npm called 'winston', which is a universal logging library with support for multiple transports. Here, successful requests are stored in 'api_logs' collection and bad requests are stored in 'api_errors' collection.
